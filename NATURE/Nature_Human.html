        <p>The relationship between human beings and nature has been changing over time, placing both in different fields. From the period of a relationship of fear, admiration, respect and hierarchy, to the present day, humanity has been moving away from nature, ceasing to be the "cave man" and little by little started to use nature in its favor, still maintaining a relationship of fear respect admiration and gratitude. Human evolution with the improvement of techniques and technology provided changes in the production of means for its existence, generating transformations in society, in the man-nature and man-man relationship. The production of consumer goods, as it increased, demanded greater exploitation of natural resources, triggering an environmental impact and redefined the place of human beings in nature and society.</p>

          <p>Living in a more balanced way that allows you to absorb all the good that happens in life is halfway to being happier and living in harmony with nature. See some simple changes you can adopt in your day-to-day life.

            In nature, all elements work for the common good, the good of life, manifesting themselves in different and impressive ways. During the period when many activities were on pause, nature maintained its course and natural splendor, with the serenity that characterizes it so well.
            
            Now that we are beginning to see a new light of hope with the gradual lifting of the confinement and that the “new normality” is beginning to take hold, it is important not to waste all the good that this moment has brought us, in particular the appreciation of family and friendship relationships and the need to be freely in contact with nature.
            
            This opportunity to live better, practice a healthier and more conscious lifestyle is within your reach. Start with a series of simple and practical changes that we can all adopt in our daily lives and that are based on relearning to value affection, interpersonal relationships and harmony between human beings and the environment that surrounds them.
            
            Deep down, it's about being healthier and being in harmony with the environment. <br>
            <hr>
            Here are some positive changes you can make to feel happier while still protecting the environment and the planet. <br>
            <hr>
            <b>Live and enjoy the time</b>
            With the intensity of the routines and the obligations that have to be fulfilled, enjoying life can be a premise that is often left behind. Take advantage of time and new experiences. Learn to take something positive out of everything that happens and be in harmony with yourself. <br>
            <hr>
            <b>One thing at a time</b>
            Multitasking is a highly appreciated tool, due to the practical usefulness of carrying out two or more tasks at the same time, but the simultaneity does not allow enjoying the moments. Try creating a to-do list and accomplish goals throughout the day, one at a time. During breaks look at nature and see how beautiful the day is. Talk to your plants and animals, take care of them the way you would like them to take care of you. <br>
            <hr>
            <b>My home, everyone's home</b>
            Balance is the watchword when we talk about calmer and healthier attitudes, more in line with mother nature. The Planet is home for all of us and it is in our hands to take care of it every day. Try hugging a tree or taking the kids to the park and teaching them the importance of birds. Take the time to listen to all the sounds around you and all the life that flourishes as we live in communion with animals and plants. <br>
            <hr>
            <b>Sharing as a life motto</b>
            If there is one thing that constraints teach us, it is that together we are stronger. Take the opportunity to dedicate more time to the family and pay more attention to the small details. Live in the present and celebrate life every day. Have you said good morning to your neighbor today? Sometimes, if we stop for a while to absorb the environment around us, we realize that with little we can make someone very happy. <br>
            <hr>
            <b>Unplug</b> 
            Turning off the television, social networks and the thousand gadgets that we have at home and enjoying the silence can be the biggest difficulty for those looking for a more present and focused lifestyle. To slow down, it is essential to synchronize your rhythm with the rhythm of nature. Forget autopilot mode and the compulsive need for consumption. Focus on a life filled with fulfillment and meaning. <br>
            
           <h4><b>" Learn to live slowly, in a balanced way and maintaining the perfect balance between home, work, health and lifestyle. Knowing how to let time pass is a virtue and a successful path towards happier routines, in line with mother nature "</b> </h4> <br>
            
            <h2 class="w3-text-green">The Planet thanks you.</h2></p>
