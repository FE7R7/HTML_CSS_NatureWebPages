          <p>With each passing year the news about the degradation of the environment increases. More and more people are consuming uncontrollably, producing garbage and living a lifestyle that does not contribute to the preservation of the planet. <br>
            <hr>
            Over the years, several projects have emerged that seek to improve the conservation of the environment, but in practice this does not end up happening the way it should and the planet suffers the impact of the neglect of governments with its preservation. <br>
            <hr>
            On the other hand, advances in technology reach levels never expected, bringing features capable of greatly improving human life. But what if all this technology was used in favor of the environment? <br>
            
            In this article we will discuss a little more about how technology can contribute to the preservation of the environment and create solutions to conserve the planet, reducing the existing environmental impacts. <br>
            <hr>
            Can technology really contribute to the environment? <br>
            
            The answer to that question is clear: absolutely yes! Many people associate technological advances with the degradation of the environment, but that is not how it works.
            
            There are some advances that really only contribute to an unbridled consumption capable of causing major impacts on the planet. <br>
            <hr>
            Every time a company invests in improvements in the creation of products without remembering to give due importance to the impacts of the entire process, the environment suffers. Therefore, some advances in technology can be harmful to the environment, such as: <br>
            <hr>
            Productions with high environmental impacts
            Large waste production
            Exploration of finite resources
            Incentive to the recurring consumption of products that do not need to be exchanged
            When a company is concerned only with its profit, the environment suffers the consequences and ends up degrading. Fortunately, there are laws that prevent technology from serving only human well-being and forgetting the environment.
            
            On the other hand, when the company understands that environmental responsibility must be an important part of its objective, it ends up having great financial returns, practicing sustainability and improving environmental aspects.</p>

            <h3><b>Creation of new environmental solutions:</b></h3>
            <p>Technology has already been able to develop so many interesting things that help preserve the environment. Some of the best known are, for example, the creation of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind. <br>
            
            Even if these are not popular sources, they have gained a lot of prominence in recent years and already supply energy to even ordinary homes. <br>
            <hr>
            In the beginning, solar energy was not a reality due to the high implementation cost, but nowadays it is possible for anyone to have access to this benefit, as the market offers many options and grows every year. <br>
            
            Another great creation of technology that helps to preserve the environment is the adoption of cars powered by energy, without gas emissions. Tesla grows every year proving that it is possible to get around in electric cars as good as or better than cars powered by fossil fuels.
            <hr>
            There are other ways technology can contribute to making the world more sustainable. See some examples of what has already been designed for this purpose: </p>

          <table class="w3-table w3-center w3-white w3-card">
            <tr>
              <td><b> Eletric cars</b></td>
              <td><b>Renewable Energy</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><b> Biodegradable material</b></td>
              <td><b>Water reuse systems</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><b>Chimney strainers</b></td>
              <td><b>Smart accessories</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><b>Technology as an EDUCATIONAL tool</b></td>
              <td><b>Researching and Development tool</b></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
          <p>All of this proves that technology can be a great ally in preserving and rebuilding the environment. It is necessary, however, that more companies and countries are willing to invest in the creation of new solutions.</p></p>
